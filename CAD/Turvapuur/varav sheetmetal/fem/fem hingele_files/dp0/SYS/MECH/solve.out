 CHECK INITIAL OPEN/CLOSED STATUS OF SELECTED CONTACT ELEMENTS
      AND LIST DETAILED CONTACT PAIR INFORMATION

   12910 CONTACT ELEMENTS &   10495 TARGET ELEMENTS ARE UNSELECTED FOR PREPARATION OF          SPLITTING.
      44 CONTACT PAIRS ARE UNSELECTED. 

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =      33.453   TIME= 16:02:22
 The maximum number of contact elements in any single contact pair is    
 2072, which is smaller than the optimal domain size of 2451 elements    
 for the given number of CPU domains (10).  Therefore, no contact pairs  
 are being split by the CNCH,DMP logic.                                  

 BECAUSE SPLIT WAS NOT DONE FOR CONNECT REGION(S), UNSELECTED ELEMENTS ARE REVERTED (SELECTED).

 constant set 23 and contact element type 23 has been set up.  The

 the same behavior.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 out-of-core memory mode.  This memory mode may provide significantly    
 worse performance compared to the in-core memory mode, depending on     
 the amount of available system memory and I/O speed.  Please monitor    
 the solver performance to ensure that the large amount of I/O to the    
 solver files does not create a bottleneck for performance.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
